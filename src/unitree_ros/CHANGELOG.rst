  In this commit, we have a new functionality which is to give robot status
  using the robot's face RGB lights.
  With this commit, only 3 types of status are currently available:

* Improving the overall package
  This commit brings some improvements to the package.
  ## What has changed:
  1. A driver class has been created, which acts as a middleware between ros and UNITREE_SDK.
  2. Brings additional features such as stand up, stand down, a way of choosing different modes etc.
  3. It allows to easily add new features to the package thanks to the separation between classes
  ## These new changes have not yet been tested on the real robot, thus need to be taken with precaution

0.1.0 (2023-05-13)
------------------
* Bump version to 0.1.0
* [feat] Add and odometry reset flag and the logic to reset it
* [feat] Implement a simple obstacle avoidance logic.
  For this simple implementaion, when a velocity command is received, the ranges of
  the front, left and right sensors are checked. If we are moving forward and an object is
  in front, the velocity command will then be ignored. Same principle is applied to the other directions.
